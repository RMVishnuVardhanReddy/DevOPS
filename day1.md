# 🧠 **DAY 1 — CLOUD COMPUTING FUNDAMENTALS**

### 🎯 Goal:

Understand *what the cloud is*, the *types of services* (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and *major providers*.

---

## 🪣 1. What is Cloud Computing?

**Definition:**
Cloud computing means **delivering computing services** (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, etc.) **over the internet** (“the cloud”) instead of on your local machine.

You pay only for what you use.

---

### ☁️ Cloud Service Models

| Model                                  | You Manage        | Cloud Manages            | Examples                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** | OS, runtime, apps | Hardware, virtualization | AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute Engine            |
| **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**       | Apps              | OS + runtime + hardware  | AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Azure App Service |
| **SaaS (Software as a Service)**       | Nothing           | Everything               | Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce                          |

---

### 🏗️ Deployment Models

| Type              | Description                          | Example                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Public Cloud**  | Shared infrastructure, pay-as-you-go | AWS, Azure, GCP         |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated to one company             | VMware, OpenStack       |
| **Hybrid Cloud**  | Mix of on-prem & cloud               | Azure Arc, AWS Outposts |
| **Multi-Cloud**   | Use multiple cloud providers         | AWS + GCP combo         |


Shared Responsibility Model:

Cloud Provider: Secures physical infrastructure, hypervisors, and core services.
Customer: Secures OS, apps, data, IAM, and configurations.
Example: AWS manages EC2 hardware; you manage EC2 instance patches and security groups.


Why It Matters for DevOps: Understanding models helps choose services (e.g., PaaS for rapid CI/CD); regions/AZs guide high-availability designs; shared responsibility informs security practices.

## 🧩 2. Major Cloud Providers (2025 Market Demand Order)

1️⃣ **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – ~31% market share
2️⃣ **Azure (Microsoft)** – ~25%
3️⃣ **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** – ~11%
4️⃣ **IBM Cloud** – ~3%
5️⃣ **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** – ~2.5%

AWS → Azure → GCP dominate 90%+ of cloud jobs.
We’ll learn all five — but in that order.

## ⚙️ 3. Key Cloud Concepts

| Concept                         | Meaning                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Region**                      | Geographic area (e.g., `ap-south-1` = Mumbai) |
| **Availability Zone (AZ)**      | Data centers within a region                  |
| **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** | Private network for your cloud resources      |
| **Elasticity**                  | Auto-scale up/down resources as needed        |
| **Pay-as-you-go**               | Pay only for what you use                     |
| **High Availability**           | Keep systems running even if components fail  |
| **Fault Tolerance**             | Ability to survive failures without downtime  |

## 💻 4. Real-Life Example

Let’s compare a **traditional server setup** vs. **cloud-based**:

| Task          | Old Way (On-Prem) | Cloud Way                |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Buy servers   | Takes weeks       | Launch EC2 in seconds    |
| Scale website | Buy more hardware | Auto-scale automatically |
| Pay           | Fixed yearly      | Only per use             |
| Backup        | Manual            | Automated (S3, Glacier)  |
